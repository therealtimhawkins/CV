After completing a degree and internship as an Electronic Engineer I have become a full stack developer with excellent inter-personel, teamwork, and technical skills. I can bring adaptability and versitility to your workplace, shown through my diverse skill set and interests. Following, are 2 projects showing my passion for clean code, TDD and working as part of a team. 

The first shows a group project completed by myself and 3 others that focuses on clear and well defined file structure, collaboration and user experience. There is also a link to the website that we built for you to take a look at!

The second is an example tech test showing object orientated programming and the single responsibility principle.

## SKILLS ##
#### Diverse Skillset ####
I have always been passionate about developing the skills that a required to follow my passions. During University I learned skills in C++, C#, Matlab and hardware design which I put to use designing my own game. Following a programming bootcamp, I am now bringing together experience in Ruby, Javascript, Rails, Node.js, Express, JQuery, Angular.js and the testing frameworks Rspec, Jasmine, Testcafe and Mocha.

#### Team Player ####
Working within a team has always been a big part of any job which I've enjoyed the most. From the stressfull deadlines of the programming bootcamp and the Manchester Airport to cycling within the peleton, I love to work hard for the success of the team.

#### Inquisitive Nature #### 
Entering the manufacturing industry at a young age I quickly obtained a desire to understand how things are built, and wanted to learn the skills to create things myself. I attended a welding NVQ2 at night school, multiple chainsaw courses and later programming classes in order to have the ability to build the things I wanted to.

#### Eye for Detail ####
Having a background in Electronic Engineering and spent 2 summers working a hardware design team has meant that I quickly adapted to finding problems within your work and designing products that are ready for a consumer.
